1,Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries,04:20:39,Data Analysis / Database Management,Beginner,4.6,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY,"In this course you�ll learn how to effectively retrieve data from a relational database table using the SQL language.   We all know that most computer systems rely on at least one database to store data. Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contacts�   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, you�re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. It�s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! That�s called �data retrieval�.   Data is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as �the language of relational databases�. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper.   You�ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio.   Next time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that it�s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, you�ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Object Oriented programming is advantageous because it allows the programmer to think in terms of the way people think of the real world, in terms of Objects like employees, airplanes, and homes for example. In procedural programming, the programmer tends to think more in terms of procedures or functions. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as C++, Classes and Objects are often used interchangeably but there is a distinction between the two. A class is a blueprint for objects. An automobile may come in many different makes, colors, and models, but each car object has those same attributes. A Car class then contains the common attributes all cars have; color, make and model. When an Object of a Car is made from the Car class, it is then assigned a specific color, such as a red Nissan Sentra or a blue Toyota Camry.

The app will interact with text files, images, strings, and a string array that are saved as resources in the project (can be accessed by reference throughout the app).

There will be an image (ImageView) below the spinner which will change (from the drawable directory) to match whichever author the user selects. Beneath this will be a piece of text (TextView) with the name of a book and the year it was published (from the strings file) which will change to match the selected author. There will be another piece of text (TextView) which will contain an appropriate quote (read from the appropriate text file in a raw directory) from the named book  Below this quote will be two buttons, one with ""Read Review"" on it, and the second with ""Submit Review"" on it.

The user will also be given the option to ""Submit Review"" whiich when clicked gives access to an imput box (EditText) into which a review can be typed.  When a ""Submit"" button is then clicked this review is written to a text file in internal storage (not resources) to a review file for that author.  If the file does not exist then the app will create the file first, then write the review to it. When the user closes the app the program will remember the final choice made by the user in their previous visit.

Since a database and its tables are designed and built to be repositories of data, getting the data into the tables is a critical activity in the building of a working database.   When building a new home, the real test of your design comes when the furniture and family move in. It�s much the same with designing and building database tables�the real test comes when you load data into the tables and begin to use it.  As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you�ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  You�ll experience first-hand the impact data types and constraints have on manipulating table data. For example, as you enter new data into a table, you�ll appreciate the extra protection provided by the primary key constraint. It will not let you insert two rows into a table that are exactly alike.   In addition to adding data to the tables, you�ll write the SQL code used to modify existing data values and to delete rows of data.

These perturbations are applied to various types of human cells including induced pluripotent stem cells from patients, differentiated into various lineages such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Then, to better understand the molecular networks that are affected by these perturbations, changes in level of many different variables are measured including: mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular phenotypic changes such as changes in cell morphology. The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is commissioned to organize, analyze, visualize and integrate this data with other publicly available relevant resources. In this course we briefly introduce the DCIC and the various Centers that collect data for LINCS. We then cover metadata and how metadata is linked to ontologies. We then present data processing and normalization methods to clean and harmonize LINCS data. This follow discussions about how data is served as RESTful APIs. Most importantly, the course covers computational methods including: data clustering, gene-set enrichment analysis, interactive data visualization, and supervised learning.
