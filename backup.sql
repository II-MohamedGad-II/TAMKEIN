88	Create a Python Application using PyMongo and MongoDB Database	00:21:23	Data plays a crucial role in application development. It plays such a crucial role that there are people called Database Administrators that specialize in just organizing the data. The traditional database used to be, and often still is, a relational database. MongoDB is more flexible than a relational database, and as such provides the developer with a database that can easily be changed during the development phase. The increased popularity of MongoDB combined with the popularity of Python has resulted in a Python library called PyMongo, which provides an API for communicating with MongoDB.  In this course, you will create a Python application, using PyMongo, that creates a MongoDB database containing words and their definitions. You will then retrieve data from the collection and display a selected Word├»┬┐┬╜s definition.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	4.60	Beginner	https://youtu.be/rE_bJl2GAY8?si=FxA1ZB_l6r_S3eKr	\N	\N	6	f	0
89	Creating Database Tables with SQL	00:15:35	In this course you will experience the process of defining, creating, and managing relational database tables using the SQL language. Tables are used as the containers for the data in a database. As such, the structure, or makeup, of each table in a relational database is critical, since it must be designed and created specifically to meet the needs of the data it will contain. The table├»┬┐┬╜s structure indicates which pieces of data are stored in a table, as well as the type and size of each piece of data.   Throughout the course, you├»┬┐┬╜ll be exposed to guidelines and rules that database designers use to make sure that the tables will keep the data as safe and accurate as possible. You├»┬┐┬╜ll learn to use SQL code to incorporate the constraints that help the database management enforce those rules. As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you├»┬┐┬╜ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  Tables that are well-designed and created correctly improve data integrity--and make data retrieval easier!  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

20	Class Creation in Object Oriented Python	00:11:00	Python is an Object Oriented Language. Object Oriented languages allow the developer to think in terms of real-world objects, such as people, cars, and animals for example. In the procedural realm, developers think in terms of functions (or procedures) and the data those functions act on. By using objects, the data can be combined with functionality ├»┬┐┬╜ a person has eye color, an animal has behavior etc. This can lead to programs that are easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.  In this course, you will create a Python application in which you will create a class definition, create a constructor for the class, create object instances of the class, and sort a list of objects created from a file.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	4.50	Beginner	https://youtu.be/wfcWRAxRVBA?si=-nuBWsucdZjyZe_6	\N	\N	1	f	0
60	Abstraction, Problem Decomposition, and Functions	00:41:08	This course is the third course in the specialization exploring both computational thinking and beginning C programming. Rather than trying to define computational thinking, we├»┬┐┬╜ll just say it├»┬┐┬╜s a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means!  This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous two courses in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking those previous courses or from personal experience, before tackling this course. The required prerequisite knowledge is listed below.   Prerequisite computational thinking knowledge: Algorithms and procedures and data collection, analysis, and representation Prerequisite C knowledge: Data types, variables, constants; STEM computations; selection; and iteration (looping)  Throughout this course the computational thinking topics you'll explore are abstraction, which is deciding which details matter for the problem you're trying to solve, and problem decomposition, which is about breaking large problems into smaller sub-problems to handle complexity. For the programming topics, you'll continue building on your C knowledge by practicing using arrays, which let you store multiple values in a single variable, and strings, which are arrays of characters. You'll also learn how to implement functions, which are the mechanism we use for problem decomposition in our C programs.  Module 1: Learn about arrays as a way to store multiple values in a single variable Module 2: Discover how we store and process strings (arrays of characters) Module 3: Explore abstraction and problem decomposition Module 4: Use functions to implement problem decomposition in your code	4.60	Advanced	https://youtu.be/MjbuarJ7SE0?si=sLkPDbrjUJk68B_f	\N	\N	1	f	0

99	Python Data Structures	12:30:49	Data structures play a crucial role in application development. The proper selection of data structures is important for efficient algorithm development. The availability of a list, for example, greatly simplifies sorting a collection of data items.  It would be difficult to do this without that data structure, as you will see. This is why Programming languages like Python have certain fundamental data structures built into the language.  In this course, you will create a Python application that reads from a file containing words and their definitions. You will use Python├»┬┐┬╜s built-in data structures to make a multiple choice quiz based on words and their definitions.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	4.40	Beginner	https://youtu.be/pkYVOmU3MgA?si=ApyzoIUBHn-pOlCg	\N	\N	1	f	0
142	Approximation Algorithms	05:52:34	Many real-world algorithmic problems cannot be solved efficiently using traditional algorithmic tools, for example because the problems are NP-hard. The goal of this course is to become familiar with important algorithmic concepts and techniques needed to effectively deal with such problems. These techniques apply when we don't require the optimal solution to certain problems, but an approximation that is close to the optimal solution. We will see how to efficiently find such approximations.   Prerequisites: In order to successfully take this course, you should already have a basic knowledge of algorithms and mathematics. Here's a short list of what you are supposed to know: - O-notation, ?-notation, ?-notation; how to analyze algorithms - Basic calculus: manipulating summations, solving recurrences, working with logarithms, etc. - Basic probability theory: events, probability distributions, random variables, expected values etc. - Basic data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps - (Balanced) binary search trees - Basic sorting algorithms, for example MergeSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort - Graph terminology, representations of graphs (adjacency lists and adjacency matrix), basic graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, topological sort, shortest paths)  The material for this course is based on the course notes that can be found under the resources tab.  We will not cover everything from the course notes. The course notes are there both for students who did not fully understand the lectures as well as for students who would like to dive deeper into the topics.  The video lectures contain a few very minor mistakes. A list of these mistakes can be found under resources (in the document called "Errata"). If you think you found an error, report a problem by clicking the square flag at the bottom of the lecture or quiz where you found the error.	4.50	Intermediate	https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMDFPuH4ZxUFiTruqjoEG8NvpjBRvPulE&si=KLZcGLRiQfGYjP4M	\N	\N	1	f	0

160	Testing and Debugging Python	05:24:40	If you have seen any of the news lately, it is not hard to imagine why software bugs cost the economy billions of dollars per year as well as costing lives. The ability to test your code (and other├»┬┐┬╜s code) is probably one of the most important skills to know as a developer. Knowing how to track down and fix bugs is also critical.  Testing can mean adding print statements to output data at certain points in a program to visually check it. Testing can also involve developing separate programs to test the functionality of the code itself.    In this course, you will create a Python application that implements a new sorting algorithm. You will also create a test to sort the algorithm, and use debugging to find bugs in the code.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	4.40	Beginner	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNlxfQ7JYooEdNrfacBAvZkF6S55sJA89	\N	\N	1	f	0
175	Simple Nearest Neighbors Regression and Classification	04:59:27	In this 2-hour long project-based course, we will explore the basic principles behind the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, as well as learn how to implement KNN for decision making in Python.   A simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems is the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The fundamental principle is that you enter a known data set, add an unknown data point, and the algorithm will tell you which class corresponds to that unknown data point. The unknown is characterized by a straightforward neighborly vote, where the "winner" class is the class of near neighbors. It is most commonly used for predictive decision-making. For instance,:  Is a consumer going to default on a loan or not? Will the company make a profit? Should we extend into a certain sector of the market?  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	5.00	Beginner	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCzCOWd7aiEXg5BV10k9THtjnS48yI-T	\N	\N	1	f	0

69	Create a Python Application using MySQL	03:41:41	Data plays a crucial role in application development. It plays such a crucial role that there are people called Database Administrators that specialize in just organizing the data. The traditional database used to be, and often still is, a relational database. MySQL is one of the most popular relational databases and is backed by the Oracle corporation as well. This provides the developer with a variety of online resources. The popularity of MySQL combined with the popularity of Python has resulted in the development of an API that makes the interface between Python and MySQL almost seamless.  In this course, you will create a Python application using Python├»┬┐┬╜s MySQL Connector that creates a MySQL database containing words and their definitions. You will then retrieve words and definitions from the database table, update a definition in the database table, and display a selected word├»┬┐┬╜s definition.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	4.40	Beginner	https://youtu.be/3vsC05rxZ8c?si=F_2-7LQsKnpWDShI	\N	\N	6	f	0
72	Create Fault Tolerant MongoDB Cluster	02:05:17	In this course, you will create a MongoDB replica set on a single Linux server to become familiar with the setup. There will be three servers, one primary server and two secondary servers. You will then populate the database collection from a csv file using the Mongo shell. You will then retrieve data from the collection to verify the data. Finally, one of the servers will be taken down and you will observe that the data is still available through a new primary server.  Database Replication is an important aspect of Data Management. By keeping copies of a database on multiple servers, it allows continuous access to data when a database server goes down. Each replica database server should be kept on a separate physical server. This ensures that if one entire physical server become unavailable for some reason, the other database servers can still be accessed. MongoDB includes the means to handle replica in a straight-forward manner. There is one primary database server through which an application may connect to the database. Any time a write occurs to the primary server, the secondary servers are updated with the new data. When the primary server goes down, one of the secondary servers takes over as the primary server. There is a minimum of three servers required for a replica set.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	5.00	Beginner	https://youtu.be/gChzfhVGqp8?si=Ss4lCApGuWJF19qz	\N	\N	6	f	0

76	C++ Arrays and Loops	00:11:43	In this project you will read weather data from a file and populate an Array with the file data. The data is then sorted in an Array, and output to another file.  Loops are used in a C++ program whenever a sequence of code must be repeated. A common use for a while loop is to read data from a file, where the file is of unknown length. A for loop, on the other hand is often used when the repeat count of a code sequence is known. A common use of a for loop is to iterate through an array. An Array is a list of items of a fixed size where each entry is the same type of data. The array could contain numbers, Strings of characters, or a user-defined data type.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	0.00	Intermediate	https://youtu.be/FaZfCuNpdg8?si=xRgd3E3Cl6zTEz62	\N	\N	4	f	0
78	Java Decision Programming	00:01:37	In Java, as in other programming languages, a decision construct is used to control the sequence of instructions that are executed under certain conditions. It allows the programmer the power to take certain actions based on various input conditions.  In this project you will create an application that yields a zodiac sign based on an input of birth month and day.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	4.90	Beginner	https://youtu.be/YdWRhNcxd0U?si=cbfnJ6MQF9acWIWa	\N	\N	4	f	0
82	Build a Guessing Game Application using Java	00:14:33	In this project you will create a guessing game application that pits the computer against the user. You will create variables, static methods, decision constructs, and loops in Java to create the game.  Learning Java gives the programmer a wide variety of career paths to choose from. Java was once the property of Sun Microsystems but is now an open-source (free) programming language that is used in web programming, mobile applications, and many desktop applications. Java is a natural choice for object-oriented programming as it contains many existing classes for the programmer to use from its feature-rich API. In addition, Java is truly cross-platform, which means it can be compiled on a Windows system and executed on a Mac or Linux system. Java contains a built-in garbage collector that removes objects no longer needed in the application which reduces memory leak issues.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We├»┬┐┬╜re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.	4.30	Beginner	https://youtu.be/j_ax_yT7KW0?si=7oJvgVBEYbGTZff5	\N	\N	4	f	0
135	C++ Classes and Objects	07:16:26	In this project you will create an application that defines a Car class and create one to many Car objects using C++.  Object Oriented programming is advantageous because it allows the programmer to think in terms of the way people think of the real world, in terms of Objects like employees, airplanes, and homes for example. In procedural programming, the programmer tends to think more in terms of procedures or functions. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as C++, Classes and Objects are often used interchangeably but there is a distinction between the two. A class is a blueprint for objects. An automobile may come in many different makes, colors, and models, but each car object has those same attributes. A Car class then contains the common attributes all cars have; color, make and model. When an Object of a Car is made from the Car class, it is then assigned a specific color, such as a red Nissan Sentra or a blue Toyota Camry.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

148	Build an App in Android Studio using onTouch	05:37:29	In this project you will build an Android app that that uses onTouch functionality to show certain information when a user clicks (Action Down) on an image, and then have the information change when the user releases (Action Up). The app also creates text files in internal storage when needed, will write to those files, and will read from those files.  The app will interact with text files, images, strings, and a string array that are saved as resources in the project (can be accessed by reference throughout the app). This app will have a piece of text (from the strings file) asking the user to select the name of an author from a spinner (a type of drop down menu where the user selects from a set of options - from the strings file). There will be an image (ImageView) below the spinner which will change (from the drawable directory) to match whichever author the user selects. Beneath this will be a piece of text (TextView) with the name of a book and the year it was published (from the strings file) which will change to match the selected author. There will be another piece of text (TextView) which will contain an appropriate quote (read from the appropriate text file in a raw directory) from the named book  Below this quote will be two buttons, one with "Read Review" on it, and the second with "Submit Review" on it.  When the user clicks the "Read Review" button a TextView will appear containing a the previously submitted review (if one exists). The user will also be given the option to "Submit Review" whiich when clicked gives access to an imput box (EditText) into which a review can be typed.  When a "Submit" button is then clicked this review is written to a text file in internal storage (not resources) to a review file for that author.  If the file does not exist then the app will create the file first, then write the review to it. When the user closes the app the program will remember the final choice made by the user in their previous visit. When launched the app will also read all information in the review files in internal storage and bring the reviews into the app for use. You will upload an APK of the app to a website called Appetize.io to test the app.  Projects in Series 1: 1. Build a Simple App in Android Studio with Java 2.

173	Build an App in Android Studio using Activities	20:08:10	In this project you will create an Android app that that uses four activities . You will begin with an Android Studio project that has an ActivityMain.java file (with nothing added to it) and an activity_main.xml file (with nothing added to it).  You will create three new activities in this project, onTouch (onTouch.java & activity_on_touch.xml), ReadReview (ReadReview.java & activity_read_review.xml), and WriteReview (WriteReview.java & activity_write_review.xml). You will have access to all of the relevant content (code and comments) needed for those files in text files so that you can copy and paste into the appropriate java and xml files in the project.  You will make adjustments to the AndroidManifest.xml file in the project which will allow your app to switch between activities when instructed to do so by the actions of the user. Once we have created our activities, inserted all of the relevant code to our java and xml files, and updated our Manifest file, we will build an APK of your app. You will then upload the APK of the app to a website called Appetize.io where you will test the app.  Projects in Series 1: 1.

112	Java Built in Data Structures	01:39:49	In this project you will read weather data from a file and populate a Java ArrayList with the file data. The data is then uniquified in a Set data structure and stored in a HashMap for accessing data by year.  Java's collections framework contains data structures that are built for efficiency. They are used to store and retrieve data in various formats. A list such as an ArrayList can be used in place of an array to contain data where the size cannot be determined ahead of time. A LinkeList is like an ArrayList, except elements can be more quickly added and deleted from it, since no shifting needs to occur. A Hashmap is used to quickly look up a value based on a key rather than a numerical index, for example, to look up a phone number based on a key containing a person's name. A Set may be used to remove duplicates from a list, simply by assigning the data to it.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

This approach will allow us to lay the foundation for the design of complex digital systems.  You will learn a set of design methodologies and will use a set of (educational-oriented) computer-aided-design tools (CAD) that will allow you not only to design small and medium size circuits, but also to access to higher level courses covering so exciting topics as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) design or computer architecture, to give just two examples.  Course topics are complemented with the design of a simple processor, introduced as a transversal example of a complex digital system. This example will let you understand and feel comfortable with some fundamental computer architecture terms as the instruction set, microprograms and microinstructions.  After completing this course you will be able to:     * Design medium complexity digital systems.    * Understand the description of digital systems using high-level languages such as VHDL.    * Understand how computers operate at their most basic level (machine language).	4.40	Intermediate	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfrxgJ1VNq1h7qMSiQlDQuvFwOptK5EBc	\N	\N	6	f	0
16	Software Design as an Abstraction	00:06:00	The design step in developing software has some unique characteristics.  First of all, it├»┬┐┬╜s the only step where drawing pictures of things is the norm.  Why is that?  What do pictures do that other representations cannot do?  Pictures have varying levels of detail; pictures have context.  Pictures├»┬┐┬╜paint a picture.  Why are these things important?  In this course, too, we begin looking at other disciplines (building architecture is a favorite one) for lessons on design.	4.80	Advanced	https://youtu.be/OF55HZPE7lQ?si=czYNihX4ClH530U4	\N	\N	2	f	0

94	Probability and Statistics: To p or not to p?	00:03:59	We live in an uncertain and complex world, yet we continually have to make decisions in the present with uncertain future outcomes.  Indeed, we should be on the look-out for "black swans" - low-probability high-impact events.  To study, or not to study?  To invest, or not to invest?  To marry, or not to marry?  While uncertainty makes decision-making difficult, it does at least make life exciting!  If the entire future was known in advance, there would never be an element of surprise.  Whether a good future or a bad future, it would be a known future.  In this course we consider many useful tools to deal with uncertainty and help us to make informed (and hence better) decisions - essential skills for a lifetime of good decision-making.  Key topics include quantifying uncertainty with probability, descriptive statistics, point and interval estimation of means and proportions, the basics of hypothesis testing, and a selection of multivariate applications of key terms and concepts seen throughout the course.	4.60	Beginner	https://youtu.be/II1u1_zjxYg?si=KMmcjzAuDs9Y7b46	\N	\N	3	f	0

150	Manipulating Data with SQL	00:39:16	In this course you will learn to write the SQL code to manipulate the data in a relational database table. You├»┬┐┬╜ll begin by populating the table with data. Since a database and its tables are designed and built to be repositories of data, getting the data into the tables is a critical activity in the building of a working database.   When building a new home, the real test of your design comes when the furniture and family move in. It├»┬┐┬╜s much the same with designing and building database tables├»┬┐┬╜the real test comes when you load data into the tables and begin to use it.  As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you├»┬┐┬╜ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  You├»┬┐┬╜ll experience first-hand the impact data types and constraints have on manipulating table data. For example, as you enter new data into a table, you├»┬┐┬╜ll appreciate the extra protection provided by the primary key constraint. It will not let you insert two rows into a table that are exactly alike.   In addition to adding data to the tables, you├»┬┐┬╜ll write the SQL code used to modify existing data values and to delete rows of data. Managing and manipulating data are SQL├»┬┐┬╜s primary purposes, and SQL coding will be a powerful addition to your tool set.

The idea is to perturb different types of human cells with many different types of perturbations such as: drugs and other small molecules; genetic manipulations such as knockdown or overexpression of single genes; manipulation of the extracellular microenvironment conditions, for example, growing cells on different surfaces, and more. These perturbations are applied to various types of human cells including induced pluripotent stem cells from patients, differentiated into various lineages such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Then, to better understand the molecular networks that are affected by these perturbations, changes in level of many different variables are measured including: mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular phenotypic changes such as changes in cell morphology. The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is commissioned to organize, analyze, visualize and integrate this data with other publicly available relevant resources. In this course we briefly introduce the DCIC and the various Centers that collect data for LINCS. We then cover metadata and how metadata is linked to ontologies. We then present data processing and normalization methods to clean and harmonize LINCS data. This follow discussions about how data is served as RESTful APIs. Most importantly, the course covers computational methods including: data clustering, gene-set enrichment analysis, interactive data visualization, and supervised learning. Finally, we introduce crowdsourcing/citizen-science projects where students can work together in teams to extract expression signatures from public databases and then query such collections of signatures against LINCS data for predicting small molecules as potential therapeutics.	4.60	Advanced	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfq4yYrYksVhkcFJ6WwgQSF9kFP3tq4wC	\N	\N	5	f	0
